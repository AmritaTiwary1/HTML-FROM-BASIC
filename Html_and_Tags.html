<!-- 
* Html is not case sensitive , we can wite head/HEAD , both are same
  But , in most of the cases, we use lower cases
* Doctype tells the browser the type of file- bcoz there were/are different types of files instead of html-- ie. xml,xhtml,etc.

* Html have 2 child---
1.head
2.body

* Inside Head ---  title,favicon,links,meta
  title and favicon(Icon) are visible on website 
  meta tag is not visible on website , it is important for servers,
